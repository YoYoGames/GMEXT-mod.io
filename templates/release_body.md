## CHANGES SINCE ${releaseOldVersion}

https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-mod.io/compare/${releaseOldVersion}...${releaseNewVersion}

## DESCRIPTION

Mod.io is a highly versatile and powerful modding platform that allows developers and enthusiasts alike to manage, distribute, and integrate user-generated content (UGC) into their games and applications. Offering a host of features, mod.io empowers developers with a cross-platform modding solution that is compatible with a wide range of platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices.

## FEATURES 

**Moderation Tools**: Mod.io offers a suite of moderation tools that enable developers to approve or reject mods before they are made available to the public. This can help ensure that all mods are in line with the developer's content guidelines.

**Version Control**: Mod.io supports versioning, allowing developers to keep track of different versions of mods. This can be useful for managing updates and changes to mods over time.

**Tagging System**: Mods can be tagged with specific categories and attributes, making it easier for users to find and discover mods. Developers can also use these tags to manage and organize mods.

**Reports and Flagging**: Mod.io includes a system for users to report or flag inappropriate or problematic mods, giving the community the ability to contribute to the moderation process.

**Dependency Management**: Mod.io allows for the handling of dependencies between mods, so if a mod relies on another to function correctly, these relationships can be managed and maintained.

**Privacy and Visibility Options**: Mod creators can set privacy levels for their mods, including options for public visibility, unlisted mods, or private mods for testing purposes.

**Automated Processes**: Mod.io provides options to automate several processes like mod approval and updates, reducing the manual effort required from developers.

## DOCUMENTATION

The full documentation of the API is available in the github wiki page and will be available as an included html file (demo **datafiles** folder) upon 2023.6 release.
