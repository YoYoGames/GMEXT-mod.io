/**
 * @function modio_auth_terms
 * @description > **mod.io Endpoint:** [Terms](https://docs.mod.io/#terms) (`GET /authenticate/terms`)
 * 
 * <br />
 * 
 * This endpoint provides the text, links and buttons you can use to get a users agreement and consent prior to authenticating them in-game (your dialog should look similar to the example below). A successful response returns a [Terms Object](https://docs.mod.io/#terms-object).
 * 
 * [[WARNING: It is a requirement to implement the terms dialog when using a 3rd party authentication flow such as Steam or Xbox Live, to ensure the user has agreed to the latest mod.io [Terms of Use](https://mod.io/terms/widget) and [Privacy Policy](https://mod.io/privacy/widget). You only need to collect the user agreement once, and also each time these policies are updated.]]
 * 
 * [[NOTE: You can use your own text and process, but must make sure the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are correctly linked, or are displayed inline using the [agreements endpoints](https://docs.mod.io/#agreements) to get the latest versions.]]
 * 
 * Be aware that you are responsible for ensuring that the users agreement is properly collected and reported. Failure to do so correctly is a breach of the mod.io Game Terms. If your game does not authenticate users or only uses the email authentication flow, you do not need to implement this dialog, but you should link to the mod.io Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in your Privacy Policy/EULA.
 * 
 * @param {function|method} callback_success The function to execute when the request is successful.
 * @param {function|method} callback_failed The function to execute when the request failed.
