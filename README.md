# GMEXT-mod.io
Repository for GameMaker's mod.io Extension

This repository was created with the intent of presenting users with the latest version available of the extension (even previous to marketplace updates) and also provide a way for the community to contribute with bug fixes and feature implementation.

The mod.io API works on all platforms using the REST API.

## Important

Do not download from the **main branch** this branch is a "_work in progress_" branch and probably has features that might be broken or not working properly, please download from the releases panel (right side instead).

## Documentation

We provide both a HTML version of the documentation included with the extension and inside the demo project (datafiles) and a fully converted version to the [Github Wiki](../../wiki) format (the latter will be the most up-to-date version, the other will follow shortly after). *If there are any PR requests with new feature implementation please make sure you also provide the documentation for the implemented features.*
